You are planning to open a new restaurant in Nashville, and are going to have an entirely new building built for this purpose. Before construction can start, you need to have a building permit issued. For planning purposes, you are trying to estimate how long you might have to wait for your permit.

The file restaurant_permits.csv contains information about all permits for new restaurants issued in Nashville for the last three years. The wait_time column contains the number of days between when a permit application was entered and when the permit was issued.

Based on this data, construct 95% confidence intervals for the following:

a) Average scenario: the mean wait time
b) Quick scenario: the 25th percentile of wait times
c) Worst-case scenario: the 90th percentile of wait times
