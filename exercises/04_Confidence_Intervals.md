# HINTS
 
The file hints_sample.csv contains a subset of the 2019 [Health Information National Trends Survey](https://hints.cancer.gov/). The HINTS is a nationally-representative survey which has been administered every few years by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) since 2003. Its target population is civilian, non-institutionalized adults aged 18 or older living in the United States.

In our subset, we will be looking at 3 variables from the survey:
**AverageTimeSitting:** During the past 7 days, how much time did you spend sitting on a typical day at home or at work?

**AvgDrinksPerWeek:** Average number of drinks per week.

**MorningNightPerson:** Someone might describe themselves as a morning-person or night-person. Which do you consider yourself to be?

1. Plot the distribution of the AverageTimeSitting variable.
2. Find the mean and standard deviation of the AverageTimeSitting varible.
3. Plot the distribution of the AvgDrinksPerWeek variable.
4. Find the mean and standard deviation of the AvgDrinksPerWeek variable.
5. What differences do you notice between these two variables?
6. Find the coefficient of variation between these variables.
7. Find a 95\% confidence interval for the mean for both of these variables. What do you notice about the margin of error for these variables?
8. The MorningNightPerson has five possible responses:

**1:** I'm definitely a morning-person

**2:** I'm more of a morning-person than a night-person.

**3:** I'm neigher a morning-person nor a night-person.

**4:** I'm more of a night-person than a morning-person.

**5:** I'm definitely a night-person.

Create a bar chart showing the percentage of our sample which falls into each category. What do you notice?

9. Create a 95\% confidence interval for the proportion of the population which consider themselves to be a night-person (for purposes of this exercise, we'll consider a response of either 4 or 5 to be a night-person).
If I claim that 1/3 of the population are night-people, does the data back up my claim?
