According to Forbes (https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackfriedman/2019/01/11/live-paycheck-to-paycheck-government-shutdown/#4693b2194f10), 78% of American workers live paycheck-to-paycheck.

Let's say we take a random sample of 40 American workers.

1) What is the probability that fewer that 25 people in our sample are living paycheck-to-paycheck?

2) What is the probability that between 25 and 35 people (inclusive) in our sample are living paycheck-to-paycheck?

3) What is the probability that at least 35 people in our sample are living paycheck-to-paycheck?

# Normal Distribution #

The file nhanes_pulse_sample.csv contains a sample of 100 men between the ages of 30 and 40 from the 2015 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.

1) Plot the histogram and Q-Q plot for the pulse rate from this sample. Does it appear that pulse rates are normally distributed?
2) Use a normal approximation to answer the following questions:
  a) Approximately what  proportion of men between the age of 30 and 40 will have a pulse less than 60?
  b) Approximately what proportion of men between the age of 30 and 40 will have a pulse greater than 100?


The file appraisal_2017.csv includes the appraised values for 1000 Davidson County homes in 2017.
1) Plot a histogram and Q-Q plot for the appraisal values. Does the distribution of the appraisal values appear to be approximately normal?
2) Apply a transformation to the appraisal values and then repeat the above step.
3) Use what you have found to approximate the proportion of total houses in Davidson County with appraisal value at least $1,000,000.

# Poisson and Exponential Distribution #
########################################
In March of 2019, the Metro Nashville Police Department received an average of 1.75 911 calls per minute.
Let's approximate the number of calls received in an hour by using a Poisson distribution with mean 1.75.

1) What is the probability of received zero calls in a minute?
2) How likely is is to receive at least 5 calls in a minute?
3) How likely is is to receive at least 8 calls in a minute?
4) How likely is it to receive between 3 and 5 calls in a minute, inclusive?
5) How likely is it to have to wait at least two minutes between calls?
6) How likely is it to have to wait at least five minutes between calls?
7) How likely is it to have to wait less than 20 seconds between calls?

Compare the real data to the theoretical distribution. Comment on how good of an approximation it is.
