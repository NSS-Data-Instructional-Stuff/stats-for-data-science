The dataset breast_cancer.csv comes from https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data.

Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.
n the 3-dimensional space is that described in: [K. P. Bennett and O. L. Mangasarian: "Robust Linear Programming Discrimination of Two Linearly Inseparable Sets", Optimization Methods and Software 1, 1992, 23-34].

The columns are as follows:

id: ID number of the patient 
diagnosis: Diagnosis, where M = malignant and B = benign
radius_mean: mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter
texture_mean: standard deviation of gray-scale values 
perimeter_mean: perimeter
area_mean: area
smoothness_mean: local variation in radius lengths 
compactness_mean: perimeter^2 / area - 1.0
concavity_mean: severity of concave portions of the contour
concave points_mean: number of concave portions of the contour
symmetry_mean: symmetry
fractal_dimension_mean: "coastline approximation" - 1


The mean, standard error and "worst" or largest (mean of the three
largest values) of these features were computed for each image,
resulting in 30 features. For instance, field 3 is Mean Radius, field
13 is Radius SE, field 23 is Worst Radius.

All feature values are recoded with four significant digits.

We will consider the following set of features: 'radius_mean', 'texture_mean', 'perimeter_mean', 'area_mean', 'smoothness_mean', 'compactness_mean', 'concavity_mean', 'concave points_mean', 'symmetry_mean','fractal_dimension_mean'

* Look at box plots for each variable against diagnosis. For each one, describe the relationship that you see (eg. malignant tend to have higher average <variable>).
* Look at the scatterplots of each variable against each other variable. What do you see?
 
Run a logistic regression model with response variable diagnosis and using all of the mean variables as predictors.
* Describe the performance of your model in terms of calibration and discrimination.
* Look at the coefficients. What is the sign of the coefficients for radius_mean? This seems unexpected. Can you explain why this happened?
