# Crashes on Weekend vs Weekday #
#################################

We are interested in studying the difference between weekends and weekdays in terms of number of reported crashes in Davidson County. We speculate that there are a larger number of reported crashes on average on weekdays as opposed to weekends.

The file crashes.csv contains a random sample of 65 randomly selected days.

1. Look at the distribution of Accident_Number for weekends vs non-weekends. Do this distributions appear to be approximately normal?

2. What are your null and alternative hypotheses?

3. What is the observed difference in the average number of crashes on weekends vs. weekdays?

4. Conduct a t-test to test your hypotheses.

5. What p-value did you get?

6. State your conclusion.

====================================================

Both regualar hypothesis testing and permutation testing:
Means:
NHANES - blood pressure and adding salt (measure effect size here, too, to show statistical significance, but not necessarily practical significance)

Proportions:
Cleaned crash data - are hit and runs more likely at night? Also, are hit and runs more likely in good weather (clear or cloudy) compared to when it is raining?
