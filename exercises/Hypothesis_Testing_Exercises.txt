# Permits Wait Time #
#####################
The file residential_permits.csv contains data on the wait time for new residential construction permits issued in Nashville.

Let's say that you own Beazer Homes Corporation and suspect that your competitor, Legacy South Builders, LLC is getting their permits issued quicker than you are.

Determine if you have a legitimate complaint. Run a t-test and report your findings.

# Crashes on Weekend vs Weekday #
#################################

We are interested in studying the difference between weekends and weekdays in terms of number of reported crashes in Davidson County. We speculate that there are a larger number of reported crashes on average on weekdays as opposed to weekends.

The file crashes.csv contains a random sample of 65 randomly selected days.

1. Look at the distribution of Accident_Number for weekends vs non-weekends. Do this distributions appear to be approximately normal?

2. What are your null and alternative hypotheses?

3. What is the observed difference in the average number of crashes on weekends vs. weekdays?

4. Conduct a t-test to test your hypotheses.

5. What p-value did you get?

6. State your conclusion.


###########################
# Late Night Hit and Runs #
###########################
You speculate that crashes ocurring late at night are more likely to be hit and run crashes. For purposes of this exercise, we have defined "late at night" to mean occurring between midnight and 5:00 AM.

The file hit_and_run.csv contains a random sample of 50 car crashes that took place in Davidson County.

1. Find the proportion of hit and run crashes for both late at night and not late at night. What is the observed difference between these two?

2. State the null and alternative hypothesis.

3. Conduct a z-test to test your hypothesis.

4. What p-value did you get?

5. State your conclusion.



====================================================

Both regualar hypothesis testing and permutation testing:
Means:
NHANES - blood pressure and adding salt (measure effect size here, too, to show statistical significance, but not necessarily practical significance)

Proportions:
Cleaned crash data - are hit and runs more likely at night? Also, are hit and runs more likely in good weather (clear or cloudy) compared to when it is raining?
