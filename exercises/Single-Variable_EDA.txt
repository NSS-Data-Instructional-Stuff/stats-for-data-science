# Library Circulation #
#######################

The file physical_circulation.csv contains the total physical circulation (checkouts + renewals) at each branch of the Nashville Public Library.

1. Find the following:
* mean circulation
* median circulation
* min, max, and range
* the 10% trimmed mean
* standard deviation
* 25th and 75th percentile and the interquartile range

2. Plot the distribution of circulation numbers. Describe the shape of the distribution. Is is symmetric? left-skewed? right-skewed? How many modes does it have?

3. Would you consider any branches to be outliers?

# Metro Government Salaries #
#############################

The file General_Government_Employees_Titles_and_Base_Annual_Salaries.csv contains the base annual salary of all Metro Government employees.

1. What are the mean and median salaries?

2. Plot the distribution of the dataset via both a histogram and boxplot. Is the data symmetric? skewed? How many modes does it have?

3. Create a KDE for the distribution as well.

4. Create a boxplot showing the distribution of salaries across the different categories of employment status. What do you notice? Which employment statuses have higher salaries on average? What can you say about the variability of salaries across employment statuses?

5. Find the standard deviation of salaries, and use this to compute z-scores for each observation.

6. Find the interquartile range of salaries.

7. Which observations would you consider to be outliers?
