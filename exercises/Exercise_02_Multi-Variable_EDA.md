# Week 2 Exercises: Statistics for Data Science

### Part 1: 2017 Appraisal Values 

The file appraisal_2017.csv contains the 2017 appraised value (total_appr) and square footage (finished_area) for a random sample of 1000 houses in Davidson County.

Read this data into a dataframe named *appraisal*.

1. Create a scatterplot of total_appr vs finished_area. 

2. By inspecting the scatterplot, describe the relationship between total_appr and finished_area. Is the direction of association positive or negative? Is the relationship linear? How strong is the relationship?

3. Do you see any points which might be considered outliers? Investigate those points.

4. Find the correlation between total_appr and finished_area. How strong is the relationship between the two variables?

### Part 2: Crashes 

The file crashes_subset.csv contains all reported crashes in Davidson County in 2018 which were classified as either head-on, front-to-rear, or a sideswipe where the cars were moving in the same direction.

Read this dataset into a dataframe named *crashes*.

1. Find the count of crashes by collision type. Create a bar plot showing the this count.

2. Create a boxplot showing number of injuries vs collision type description. What do you notice?

3. Find the average number of injuries per crash by collision type. Which type of crash has the highest average number of injuries. Create a box plot to show the distribution of injuries by collision type.

4. Compare the rate of hit and run crashes by category. Create a bar plot to show what you find. What do you notice?
