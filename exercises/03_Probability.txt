According to Forbes (https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackfriedman/2019/01/11/live-paycheck-to-paycheck-government-shutdown/#4693b2194f10), 78% of American workers live paycheck-to-paycheck.

Let's say we take a random sample of 40 American workers.

1) What is the probability that fewer that 25 people in our sample are living paycheck-to-paycheck?

2) What is the probability that between 25 and 35 people (inclusive) in our sample are living paycheck-to-paycheck?

3) What is the probability that at least 35 people in our sample are living paycheck-to-paycheck?

# Poisson and Exponential Distribution #
########################################
In March of 2019, the Metro Nashville Police Department received an average of 1.75 911 calls per minute.
Let's approximate the number of calls received in an hour by using a Poisson distribution with mean 1.75.

1) What is the probability of received zero calls in a minute?
2) How likely is is to receive at least 5 calls in a minute?
3) How likely is is to receive at least 8 calls in a minute?
4) How likely is it to receive between 3 and 5 calls in a minute, inclusive?
5) How likely is it to have to wait at least two minutes between calls?
6) How likely is it to have to wait at least five minutes between calls?
7) How likely is it to have to wait less than 20 seconds between calls?

Compare the real data to the theoretical distribution. Comment on how good of an approximation it is.
