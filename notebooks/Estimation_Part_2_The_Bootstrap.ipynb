It is easy to understand and implement, but is just recently gaining popularity, since it is not really feasible without modern computing power. The bootstrap allows us to substitute fast computation for theoretical math.\n",

    "The Central Limit Theorem says that for a large enough sample, the sampling distribution of the mean (or with some additional work, the proportion, or difference of means or proportions) is close enough to being normal that we can build confidence intervals. The trouble is, we don't know just how large \"large enough\" is. \n",

For example, we might be interested in a confidence interval for the median. Tradional techniques of confidence intervals break down here, because we have to have some idea about the sampling distribution of this statistic. The bootstrap does not need this, since it is built out of the sample itself."
