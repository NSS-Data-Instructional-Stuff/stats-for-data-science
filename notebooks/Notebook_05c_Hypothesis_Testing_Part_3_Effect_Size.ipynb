    "This means that if you are working with a large sample (as you often are when doing data analysis), you can uncover a statistically significant result, which is of no practial importance. \n",

    "For example, clinical trial researchers sometimes refer to this low power when a result is statistically significant but not \"clinically significant.\" They mean by this that one treatment may be better than placebo, but the difference is so marginal that it would make no difference to the patient within a clinical context."
