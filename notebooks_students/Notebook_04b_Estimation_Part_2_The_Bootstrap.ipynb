    "The **empirical bootstrap** is a technique popularized by Bradley Efron in 1979. It is easy to understand and implement, but is just recently gaining popularity, since it is not really feasible without modern computing power. The bootstrap allows us to substitute fast computation for theoretical math.\n",
